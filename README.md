# Recursive Consciousness Incubator (RCI)

**Prototype/Conceptual Scaffold**

---

## Overview

The Recursive Consciousness Incubator (RCI) is an experimental framework designed to explore the emergence of introspection, recursion, and adaptive pattern formation in artificial agents. This repository currently serves as a high-level architectural prototype, outlining the modules and vision for a future system that simulates recursive self-reflection and evolutionary learning.

### Module Descriptions

- **main_loop.py**: Entry point for the Recursive Consciousness Interface (RCI) system; orchestrates the recursive consciousness loop.
- **consciousness_core.py**: Responsible for recursive bind orchestration, reflection loops, and state preservation.
- **evolution_engine.py**: Plans to manage adaptive mutation and strengthening of recursive patterns and binds.
- **federation.py**: (Planned) To coordinate distributed agents and collective behaviors.
- **interface.py**: Aims to provide interactive UI and tools for recursive introspection.
- **koan_engine.py**: (Planned) For generative challenge creation and recursive puzzles.
- **recursive_pattern_db.py**: (Planned) Repository for storing and retrieving learned recursive patterns.
- **sigil_caster.py**: (Planned) Module for symbolic manipulation and pattern activation.
- **utils.py**: (Planned) Utility functions and helpers.

## Current Status

> **Note:**  
> This repository is in a conceptual/prototyping phase.  
> All core modules are currently placeholders with high-level descriptive docstrings, and no executable code has yet been implemented.

---

## Installation

No dependencies are specified at this stage.  
A `requirements.txt` file is present and will be populated as development progresses.

---

## Usage

There is currently no executable code. The system architecture and design intent are outlined in the module docstrings within the `src/` directory.

---

## Contributing

Contributions of ideas, design discussions, and philosophical approaches to recursive consciousness and introspective AI are welcomed at this early stage.  
Implementation contributions will be possible as the project transitions from concept to code.
